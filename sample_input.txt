India’s space agency ISRO has successfully launched its latest Earth observation satellite from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. The satellite, named EOS-04, was launched aboard a PSLV rocket and will help in weather monitoring, agricultural planning, and disaster management.

The launch marks another step forward in India’s expanding space capabilities. EOS-04 will provide high-resolution images that will be used for mapping and surveillance. The mission is part of a broader initiative by ISRO to modernize and enhance its satellite fleet with state-of-the-art technology.
